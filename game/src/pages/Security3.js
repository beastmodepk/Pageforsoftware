        I have been asleep for a while, I drank herbal tea and took some
        medication but I still don’t feel better… I should call my parents and
        ask them for help!

        Once you have a virus on your computer it can be pretty complicated to
        get rid of it. Even though it might seem that you deleted the virus, it
        could still hide somewhere and gradually destroy your computer or erase
        your data. That is why you should never trust unknown senders and
        hardware. If your computer got infected nevertheless you should
        immediately shut it down to prevent it spreading through your computer
        or, even worse, to other of your belongings. You should take it to a
        computer specialist who might be able to restore your computer but if
        not, all your important data could be lost. This is why you should
        always make safety copies on independent hard drives and in a cloud.
