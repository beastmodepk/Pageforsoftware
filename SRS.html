<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The program’s Software Requirements Specification (SRS) of our edutainment game DigiSafe incorporates the purpose, scope and functionality of the system. Each section is designed to form a general, collective understanding of the program for the user as well as the implementer. This will help break down critical requirements and expectations clearly. 
</p>
<p>The purpose of this software is to introduce children into the digital world and the Internet, and to give them important information on how to safely and confidently use digital media and the Internet as tools in everyday life to their benefit while staying safe and healthy. DigiSafe falls into the category of storyline games where you have to answer questions correctly to solve quests and proceed. Using simplified and pictorial scenarios, the children are taught how to behave in certain situations and apply their new knowledge in questions afterwards.
</p>
<p>In the first part of the SRS, the scope of DigiSafe is broken down into 8 topics that prepare children for entering the digital world. Definitions and abbreviations are provided to have a common understanding of game specific vocabulary. The paragraph about the organization of the SRS gives the reader an impression of how the remaining content is structured.
</p>
<p>In the second part of the SRS, critical information on the product that includes product perspective and product functions is provided. This should help forming an idea about how the program will perform when it is thoroughly implemented. The user characteristics will give an impression how the game requirements depend on the user’s expertise and skill set. The constraints, assumptions and dependencies help understanding why certain features are being chosen and why others are left out. Apportioning future requirements paints a picture in which direction the game could develop in the bigger picture.
</p>
<p>In the third and fourth part the specific requirements and the modeling requirements are defined in detail to give an impression how the requirements and goals are conveyed to the actual software implementation. The modeling requirements portray the relationship between the different entities system and user’s input, whereas the specific requirements focus on technical specifications.
</p>
<p> In the last part of this document, the prototype of DigiSafe is introduced and it is described which steps to take to use it. This will help getting a feeling of how the end product will perform.
</p>
<h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of Software Requirements Specification is to lay out the description, its parameters and goals of the software. The SRS forms the basis of agreement between the developer and clients. 
</p>
<p>The intended audience of the SRS are all stakeholders, namely the developers, project managers and customers. The customers are teachers, parents and executives of the education system.
</p>
<h3>1.2 Scope </h3>
<p>“DigiSafe is an interactive edutainment game that playfully teaches children basic concepts in digital safety and responsibility. Pictorial scenarios introduce the children to different situations on the internet and explain important guidelines. Children can then apply the new information in simple questions that pick up the prior depicted scenario. The game provides immediate positive and constructive feedback to ensure consistent motivation. Coherently, no scores or points will be awarded.”
